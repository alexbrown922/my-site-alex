These lobsters are vital to the state’s economy, as fisheries prosper when the lobster populations are healthy and abundant. Threats to the lobster population have encouraged sustainability efforts, resulting in the establishment of marine protected areas (MPAs) (4). Marine protected areas serve a dual purpose by ensuring the ecosystem’s vitality and safeguarding the lobster population, improving the health of nearby fisheries. The effectiveness of marine protected areas in increasing lobster abundance is seen as lobster catch rates tend to be higher at the borders between MPAs and non-MPAs (3).\nIn terms of ecology, Panulirus interruptus play an important role in curbing the population of herbivorous sea urchins. California spiny lobsters are predators of two species of sea urchins, whose consumption patterns affect the health of kelp forests (6). By managing sea urchin populations, these lobsters encourage the growth of kelp forests off the California coast, benefiting members of the marine ecosystem that rely on kelp forests for their habitat.\nIn the Santa Barbara Channel, divers recorded counts and measurements of California spiny lobsters from 2012 to 2017 at five long-term ecological research sites: Arroyo Quemado, Carpinteria, Mohawk Reef, Isla Vista, and Naples Reef (Fig. 1). In addition, researchers counted the number of lobster trap buoys at each location within this time period to determine fishing pressure on the California spiny lobster. Two of the five sites observed, Naples Reef and Isla Vista, are marine protected areas. This report examines lobster abundance, carapace length (mm), and fishing pressure based on trap presence at the five sites.\n Data, Data Analysis and Statistical Methods The data used in this study was provided by the Santa Barbara Coastal Long Term Ecological Research Program and analyzed in RStudio5. Lobster samples were obtained from 40 m transects defined by six permanent markers. Lobster sizes (in mm) were gauged by visual examination of the carapace length. The number of lobster trap buoys present in each site were used to determine fishing pressure.\nDivers collected lobster abundance and size measurements each year between 2012 and 2017 before the start of the fishing season in the late summer. Lobster trap counts were gathered every two to four weeks during the lobster fishing season, spanning October to March, each year from 2012 to 2017.\nA single factor ANOVA test was used to compare mean lobster sizes across the five sites in 2017. After an ANOVA was performed, a Tukey’s HSD post hoc test was performed to determine which sites had significantly different mean lobster sizes from each other. Student’s t-tests were utilized to compare mean lobster sizes in 2012 and 2017 at each site. A chi-square test determined if the proportion of observed lobsters at each site above the legal minimum length of 82.6 mm differed significantly across the five LTER locations.\nLobster Abundance and Fishing Pressure from 2012 to 2017 (1) Figure 2. California Spiny Lobster Abundance at Five Long-Term Ecological Research Sites in the Santa Barbara Channel, 2012-2017. Divers collected lobster abundance data for Panulirus interruptus at each of the five sites each year in late summer, before the start of the fishing season. The sites are Arroyo Quemado (AQUE), Naples Reef (NAPL), Mohawk Reef (MOHK), Isla Vista (IVEE), and Carpinteria (CARP). NAPL and IVEE are marine protected areas; AQUE, MOHK, and CARP are non-marine protected areas. Data source: Reed, D., Santa Barbara Coastal Long Term Ecological Research Project.\nLobster abundance, based on the amount of lobsters counted by divers before the start of the fishing season from 2012 to 2017, changed at Arroyo Quemado, Naples Reef, Mohawk Reef, Isla Vista, and Carpinteria within this time period (Fig. 2). Carpinteria and Isla Vista witnessed the largest gains in lobster count from 2012 to 2017, with a range of and 580 lobsters, respectively. In contrast, lobster abundance at Mohawk Reef and Naples Reef peaked in 2015, and subsequently declined. At Arroyo Quemado, lobster count does not display any drastic changes, although count peaked in 2014 and declined afterwards.\nFigure 3. Commercial Lobster Trap Floats at Long-Term Ecological Research Sites in the Santa Barbara Channel, 2012-2017. Data on the number of floats was collected every two to four weeks Oct-Mar, during the lobster fishing season. Commercial lobster trap floats act as indicators of fishing pressure at each location. NAPL and IVEE lack commercial trap floats because they are marine protected areas. Data source: Reed, D., Santa Barbara Coastal Long Term Ecological Research Project.\nFrom 2012 to 2017, the number of lobster trap buoys were counted at Arroyo Quemado, Carpinteria, and Mohawk Reef to gauge fishing pressure at each site (Fig. 3). Isla Vista and Naples Reef did not have any commercial lobster trap floats within their regions because they are marine protected areas. Overall, each site saw a decrease in the amount of lobster trap floats present during this time period. At Arroyo Quemado, lobster traps increased from 2012 to 2013, leveled off from 2013 to 2016, and decreased by 637 traps from 2016 to 2017. Carpinteria witnessed a peak in lobster traps in 2016, followed by a sharp drop in lobster trap numbers in 2017 resulting in a difference of 1068 traps. In contrast to these general patterns at Arroyo Quemado and Carpinteria, Mohawk Reef displayed a steadily declining number of lobster trap floats from 2012 to 2017.\n Average Lobster Size between Each Location in 2017 (2)  Table 1: Table 1. Mean Lobster Sizes at 5 Locations in 2017. Researchers collected Panulirus interruptus lobster abundance in 2017 at the sites of Arroyo Quemado (AQUE), Naples Reef (NAPL), Mohawk Reef (MOHK), Isla Vista (IVEE), and Carpinteria (CARP). Listed are the average carapace length (mm) of lobsters collected at each location and the standard deviation of the length (mm) of samples taken at each location. Data source: Reed, D., Santa Barbara Coastal Long Term Ecological Research Project.     Mean Lobster Carapace Length (mm)  Standard Deviation (mm)      Arroyo Quemado  73.90  11.89    Carpenteria  72.23  13.21    Isla Vista  71.45  14.32    Mohawk Reef  72.00  9.28    Naples Reef  76.23  11.39     To assess the differences in lobster sizes at each of the five locations in the Santa Barbara County area, an average of the measured carapace length (in mm), which is defined as the rear of the eye socket to the rear of the carapace on a line parallel to the center line of the body shell (7), was taken for each lobster sample in 2017. A significant difference was found in mean carapace length of lobster samples taken at Naples Reef and Isla Vista as well as Naples Reef and Carpinteria in 2017, according to a one way ANOVA test (F(4, 1663) = 3.4, p \u0026lt; 0.01, \\(\\alpha\\) = .05, with post-hoc analysis by Tukey’s HSD, p \u0026lt; 0.01, \\(\\alpha = 0.05\\). n = 67 (AQUE), n = 705 (CARP), n = 606 (IVEE), n = 178 (MOHK), n = 112 (NAPL). However, the rest of the locations saw no significant difference in mean carapace length of observed samples.\nIt is notable that a significant difference was found in average lobster sizes between two of the marine protected areas (Naples Reef and Isla Vista). The reason for this difference could be caused by a multitude of external environmental factors, such as urban development in Isla Vista, and is not necessarily an indictment of the effectiveness of marine protection in Isla Vista in comparison to Naples Reef. Further research on why Isla Vista’s average lobster size is smaller in comparison to Naples Reef and the other locations is needed.\n Average Lobster Size between 2012 and 2017 at MPA and non-MPA Sites (3) California spiny lobster sizes were measured by divers at marine protected areas (Isla Vista and Naples Reef) and non-marine protected areas (Arroyo Quemado, Carpinteria, and Mohawk Reef) in 2012 and 2017. Of the five locations, only lobsters at Mohawk Reef exhibited a significant change in mean size between 2012 (77.25 ± 10.59 mm) and 2017 (72 ± 9.28 mm), based on results from a two-sample Student’s t-test [t(259) = 4.07, p \u0026lt; 0.05, \\(\\alpha\\) = 0.05]. In addition, the effect size is moderate (Cohen’s d = 0.54).\n Association between Site and Legal Lobster Carapace Length (4) The legal minimum for lobster carapace length is 82.6 mm. The counts of legal and non-legal lobsters sizes were observed at each of the five LTER locations and recorded. The counts were converted into proportions of legal vs non-legal sizes at each of the five locations and a Pearson’s chi-squared test for association was run on the proportions to determine if an association between the relative proportion of legal sized lobsters vs non-legal sized lobsters and location was present. After running the test an association between location and legal-sized lobsters was found, \\(\\chi^2\\) = 18.497 \\(\\chi^2\\)(df) = 4, p \u0026lt; 0.001 In the observed proportions of legal vs non-legal lobsters, three of the five locations (Arroyo Quemado, Carpinteria, and Isla Vista) had similar percentages of legal vs non-legal sized lobsters at approximately 24%, 25%, and 21%, respectively. Mohawk Reef had the smallest percentage of legal-sized lobsters at approximately 13% and Naples Reef had the largest percentage at approximately 33%.\nThese percentages complement the average carapace length observed at each of the five locations as well. The average carapace length at Naples Reef was the largest of the five locations at 76.23 mm. This number supports the finding of Naples Reef having the largest percentage of legal-sized lobsters at approximately 33%. The average carapace length at Isla Vista was observed to be 71.45 mm, which was the smallest of the five locations. However, Isla Vista had the the second smallest percentage of legal-sized lobsters at 21% behind Mohawk Reef at 13%. This discrepancy is most likely due to the significant difference in sample size at the two locations. Isla Vista’s sample size was 606 lobsters observed and Mohawk Reef’s sample size was 178 lobsters observed in 2017.\n  Conclusion California spiny lobsters (Panulirus interruptus) are essential to the sustainability of the California coast marine ecosystem. The lobsters reduce pressure on kelp forests by consuming herbivorous sea urchins, ensuring kelp growth and allowing other marine life to thrive in this ecosystem. A valuable resource for the California state economy as well, the lobsters contribute to the vitality of nearby fisheries. This report aims to analyze the effectiveness of marine protected areas (MPAs) in sustaining California spiny lobster populations by comparing data on lobster abundance, carapace length (mm), and fishing pressure at Arroyo Quemado, Carpinteria, Mohawk Reef, Isla Vista, and Naples Reef. The following statements summarize the main findings of the report:\nCalifornia spiny lobsters observed at the marine protected area of Naples Reef had the largest average carapace length (mm) measured of the five locations in 2017.\n The average carapace length (mm) of California spiny lobsters observed in 2017 differed significantly at the marine protected area of Naples Reef and Isla Vista as well as Naples Reef and Carpinteria. All other locations saw no significant difference in average carapace length (mm).\n California spiny lobster sizes were measured by divers at marine protected areas (Isla Vista and Naples Reef) and non-marine protected areas (Arroyo Quemado, Carpinteria, and Mohawk Reef) in 2012 and 2017. Of the five locations, only lobsters at Mohawk Reef exhibited a significant change in mean size between 2012 and 2017.\n There is an association between location and the proportion of legal-sized (\u0026gt;=82.6 mm) California spiny lobster carapace length (mm) and below legal-sized (\u0026lt;82.6 mm) California spiny lobster carapace length (mm).\n  The collection of data on lobster abundance, lobster carapace length (mm), and fishing pressure at each of the five locations observed should continue in the future to better determine the effectiveness of MPAs on population health at each site. Based on the data collected, Naples Reef has the largest average lobster size in 2017 of samples collected at each site, which is a positive sign for the effectiveness of the marine protected area designation. However, the other marine protected area off Isla Vista had the smallest average lobster size in 2017. These contradictory findings should be further explored in future studies. The marine ecosystem of the Santa Barbara Channel will continue to change in the coming decades due to the pressures of climate change, which will bring warmer ocean temperatures and new marine life migration patterns to the region. Data collection of the California spiny lobster at each of the SBC LTER long term kelp forest study sites will be vital as new pressures will present themselves. Monitoring the lobster populations in the coming years will provide more evidence to introduce new and maintain existing MPAs.\n References  ","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"96e517d93502c72223f06e78217910d2","permalink":"/project/california-spiny-lobster/assignement_4_jessica_alex/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/california-spiny-lobster/assignement_4_jessica_alex/","section":"project","summary":"Introduction The California spiny lobster (Panulirus Interruptus) inhabits crevices and kelp holdfasts hollowed out by grazing sea urchins in rocky marine regions from California down to the Baja California Peninsula (1).

In the 1930s, male and female undergraduate enrollment was approximately equal in colleges in the United States. After the 1930s, particularly following the end of World War II in 1945, male enrollment began to increase at a faster rate than female enrollment due to American soldiers returning from overseas. This increased male-to-female ratio of undergraduate students continued till the 1970s. However, the trajectory altered in the 1980s, with greater rates of female enrollment, and by 2003, there were 1.30 females for every male undergraduate. This pattern of increasing female student enrollment can also be seen among graduate school enrollments. The academic year of 2016-2017 marked the eighth consecutive year in which females earned more doctoral degrees than males.\nAlthough college-enrolled females outnumber college-enrolled males in America, college-educated women are still not paid equally compared to college-educated men with similar skills and backgrounds. In addition, further categorizations using racial groups better depict wage gaps among college-educated males and females. A study conducted in 1998 discovered that there is a ten to fifteen percent wage difference between white women, black men, black women, Asian men, and Asian women in comparison to white men who have the same characteristics and qualities of college education. Furthermore, this inequality in wages occurs among males and females with graduate degrees. A 2015 study determined that female science and engineering doctoral recipients report having lower salaries than their male colleagues.\nMany studies have been conducted to analyze undergraduate enrollment and wage gaps for college-educated people based on sex. However, studies that specifically examine male and female graduate students in these areas are more elusive. Thus, this study seeks to add to the existing literature regarding graduate students by investigating male and female graduate school enrollment from 1967 to 2015. Furthermore, this paper aims to identify shifts in female PhD recipients by field at three different periods in history. Lastly, this study will analyze patterns between salary and sex by examining median salaries for male and female doctoral recipients in 2015 and academic salaries for professors in American colleges. By conducting this research, this study seeks to add value to policy makers, social activists, and academic professionals in addressing sex and professional pay disparities and inequities.\n Data and Methods The graduate enrollment data used in this study was provided by the U.S. Department of Education’s National Center for Education Statistics Higher Education General Information Survey. Information on doctoral recipients and their median salaries were obtained from the National Science Foundation’s National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics Survey of Earned Doctorates. In addition, Fox J. and Weisberg, S. (2011) An R Companion to Applied Regression, Second Edition Sage provided data on professor characteristics and associated salaries, gathered from surveys.\nThe data used in this study was analyzed in R. Two separate linear regressions were created to examine changes in female and male graduate enrollment between 1967 and 2015, with a Pearson’s r test of correlation. To analyze changes in female PhD recipients by field in 1985, 2000, and 2015, a chi-square test was conducted. A non-parametric, paired Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test was used to compare the median salaries of male and female doctorate recipients within the same field who are currently employed as postdoctoral researchers. In addition, another Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test compared the median salaries of male and female doctorate recipients within the same field, but examined only those employed outside of postdoctoral research. Lastly, a multiple linear regression model was created to analyze university faculty salaries in the U.S. based on sex, faculty rank, field, and the number of years since obtaining a PhD.\n Results and Discussion A Comparison of Male and Female Graduate Enrollment From 1967 to 2015 The total number of both male and female graduate students enrolled in U.S. institutions of higher education grew rapidly between 1967 and 2015, according to data from the U.S. Department of Education. However, the rate at which female graduate student enrollment increased compared to their male counterparts was far greater during this period (Fig. 1). In 1967, there were approximately 38,000 more male graduate students enrolled in U.S. colleges than female graduate students, but by 1988, female graduate students outnumbered their male counterparts. In 2015, the last year of recorded data, enrolled graduate females outnumbered males by nearly 50,000 in American colleges and universities.\nFigure 1. Relationship between total female graduate enrolled students and year (1967-2015) and total male graduate enrolled students and year (1967-2015). Year significantly predicts total female graduate enrollment (t(47) = 51.659, p \u0026lt; 0.001) with a strong positive correlation between the two variables (Pearson’s r = 0.99). Year also significantly predicts total male graduate enrollment (t(47) = 16.612, p \u0026lt; 0.001) with a strong positive correlation between the two variables (Pearson’s r = 0.92).\nTo determine whether there was an association between year and and number of enrolled male graduate students, a single variable linear regression model was run with ‘year’ being the independent variable and ‘total enrolled male graduate students’ being the dependent variable. The year significantly predicts total male graduate enrollment (t(47) = 16.612, p \u0026lt; 0.001) with a strong positive correlation between the two variables (Pearson’s r = 0.92), (Fig. 1). To determine whether there was an association between year and and number of enrolled female graduate students, another single variable linear regression model was run with ‘year’ being the independent variable and ‘total enrolled female graduate students’ being the dependent variable. In this case, year also significantly predicts total female graduate enrollment (t(47) = 51.659, p \u0026lt; 0.001) with a strong positive correlation between the two variables (Pearson’s r = 0.99), (Fig. 1).\nWhile there is an association between both the number of enrolled male and female graduate students and the year, it is important to note some key differences between the two groups. The proportion of female graduate students enrolled part-time is far higher in comparison to the proportion of female graduate students enrolled full-time. Part-time female graduate students surpassed part-time male graduate students in the mid-1970s, whereas full-time female graduate students surpassed the number of full-time male graduate students in the late-1990s.\nThe slower growth of full-time female graduate students in comparison to part-time female enrolled graduate students can potentially be explained due to differences in gender roles in the 1970s and 1980s. During this time it was still common place for women to be the primary caregiver for their family, while men were the primary source of income (insert citation). Beginning in the 1990s, the number of full time female graduate students increased rapidly, perhaps as a result of the changing societal views on gender roles.\n Changes in Female PhD recipients in Four Fields in 1985, 2000, and 2015 The number of female PhD recipients in physical and earth sciences, engineering, education, and humanities and the arts increased from 1985 to 2015. The amount of increase in female PhD recipients was substantial in physical and earth sciences, engineering, and humanities and the arts, while the increase in education was rather nominal.\n Table 1: Table 2. Number of Female PhDs in Four Fields in 1985, 2000, and 2015. Female PhD recipients increased significantly in physical and earth sciences and engineering between 1985 and 2015. However, the increases in female PhD recipients in humanities and the arts increased marginally. Meanwhile, female PhD recipients in education have declined since 2000.    Field of Study  1985  2000  2015      Physical Sciences/Earth Sciences  569  1022  1988    Engineering  198  838  2301    Education  3491  4179  3502    Humanities/Arts  1392  2672  2832     In order to determine if a significant association exists between female PhD recipients by field and year, we complied the raw counts of female PhD recipients by field and the year in which they were recorded (1985, 2000, 2015), (Table 2). After the raw counts were compiled, we converted the raw counts into proportions to run a Pearson’s chi-square test for association between year and the number of female PhD recipients by field. After running the test, an association between year and female PhD recipients by field was found, (\\(\\chi^2\\) = 2073.3 \\(\\chi^2\\)(df) = 6, p \u0026lt; 0.001).\nThe most interesting aspect in this data is the amount of increase in female PhD recipients in STEM fields (physical/earth sciences, engineering). The amount of female PhD recipients in physical and earth sciences increased nearly 350% between 1985 and 2015, whereas the amount of female PhD recipients in engineering increased by over 1000%. While the amount of female PhD recipients in humanities and arts doubled, the amount of female PhD recipients in education barely increased from 1985 to 2015 by just 11 more recipients. In fact, the amount of female PhD recipients in education decreased from its peak in 2000 of 4,179 to 3,502 in 2015 (Table 2).\nThe large increases in female PhD recipients in STEM fields can also potentially be explained in shifting societal notions of what is considered “so-called” male or female professions. In the 1980s, it was still a popular notion in American society that “female professions” did not usually include professions such as a scientist or an engineer. However, as these notions have shifted significantly over the past several decades the number of female PhD recipients in STEM have increased dramatically.\n A Comparison of Male and Female PhD Recipients’ Salaries for Postdoctoral and Other Employment Positions in 2015 Median salaries for male and female doctorate recipients in 2015 were examined to determine if the salaries are significantly different based on sex. A paired non-parametric Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test was used to compare median salaries for males and females within the same field, currently in postdoctoral positions. A separate paired Wilcoxon Sign-Rank test examined median salary difference for male and female doctorate recipients within the same field and employed in positions outside of postdoctoral research. In addition, Cliff’s delta tests were carried out to quantify the effect size of these groups.\nFor male and female doctorate recipients who are currently working as postdoctoral researchers, median salary did not differ significantly (V = 19.5, p = 0.9, \\(\\alpha\\) = 0.05, Cliff’s delta = negligible). In the fifteen fields examined, only three fields exhibited median male salaries that were greater than salaries of females: mathematics and computer sciences, education, and other fields not related to science and engineering. Postdoctoral pay in education depicted the greatest disparity in salary in preference of males, with males making $5,000 more than female postdoctoral researchers.\nIn contrast to salaries of postdoctoral researchers, a significant difference in median salary was determined for male and female doctorate recipients currently employed in positions not related to postdoctoral research (V = 101, p \u0026lt; 0.01, \\(\\alpha\\) = 0.05). In addition, the effect size is small to moderate (Cliff’s Delta = 0.21). Twelve out of the fifteen fields analyzed exhibited higher median salaries for males than females. The largest difference in median salaries, in which males were making more than females, was in the mathematics and computer sciences field, with a salary difference of $15,000. This finding should be examined further in future research to analyze why salaries differ for male and female doctorate recipients employed outside of postdoctoral research even though these recipients are within the same field.\n An Analysis of Faculty Salaries in United States Higher Education  Table 2. Multivariate Linear Regression for Faculty Salaries in the US. Results of the multivariate linear regression to examine faculty salaries in the US in comparison to sex, faculty rank, department type, and years since obtaining a PhD.        Dependent variable:           Salary       Male (Sex)   4,349.366 (3,875.393)    Assistant Professor (Rank)   -13,104.150*** (4,167.315)    Professor (Rank)   32,928.400*** (3,544.403)    Years Since PhD   61.011 (127.010)    Applied Department   13,937.470*** (2,346.534)    Constant   80,988.470*** (4,931.844)       Observations   397    R2   0.447    Adjusted R2   0.440    Residual Std. Error   22,663.240 (df = 391)    F Statistic   63.266*** (df = 5; 391)       Note:  p\u0026lt;0.1; p\u0026lt;0.05; p\u0026lt;0.01    Many characteristics of faculty members at American universities have the potential to affect their salaries. To examine the influence of faculty characteristics on salary, a multiple linear regression model was created. The characteristics of faculty members included in the model are sex, faculty position, field, and years since obtaining a doctorate degree. The model [salary = 80,988.47 + 4,349.37(Male) - 13,104.15(Assistant Professor) + 32,928.40(Professor) + 61.01(Years Since PhD) + 13,937.47(Applied Field); in US $] significantly predicts faculty salary (F(391) = 63.27, p \u0026lt; 0.001, R2 = 0.44).\nAccording to this model, if all other variables are the same, then male professors make $4,349.37 more than female professors. In addition, this model indicates that faculty members with ranking as professors make $32,928.40 more than associate professors, if every other variable remains the same. Thus, professor rank seems to have more influence on faculty salary than the faculty member’s sex. Furthermore, it is observed that faculty members in applied fields earn $13,937.47 than faculty members in theoretical fields, if all other variables remain the same. In addition, it is interesting, but not surprising, to note that the model indicates that assistant professors make less money than associate professors, as assistant professor positions are lower than associate ones.\nIt is important to note that 44% of the variance in faculty salaries can be predicted by the model’s variables. The model created is a good fit in determining the influence of sex, faculty position, field, and years since obtaining a PhD on faculty salaries because these variables show a linear relationship with faculty salary. Future research can focus on further examining the relationships between these factors and faculty salaries. Additionally, future studies can apply this model to faculty members of universities in other countries.\n  Conclusion The amount of enrolled female graduate students and PhD recipients has increased drastically in the past several decades to the point that there are currently more enrolled female graduate students and female PhD recipients by year compared to males. However, these increases in female graduate enrollment and PhD recipients has not necessarily translated into pay equity across professions in comparison to their male counterparts. This report aims to characterize key differences in gender regarding graduate enrollment, PhD recipients, postdoc and non-postdoc employment pay as well as the relationships between faculty salaries and several faculty characteristics. The following statements summarize the key findings of the report:\nThere is an association between year and total enrolled male and female graduate students between 1967 and 2015. Part-time enrolled female graduate students grew faster than full-time enrolled female graduate students. There is a significant association between female PhD recipients and year (1985, 2000, 2015). Female PhD recipients grew substantially from 1985 to 2015 in the STEM fields of physical/earth science and engineering. Female PhD recipients grew marginally from 1985 to 2015 in humanities and arts. Female PhD recipients in education stayed relatively stagnant from 1985 to 2015 Median salary between male and female postdoctoral researchers did not differ significantly. Median salary between male and female doctorate recipients working outside of postdoctoral research differed significantly, with the largest difference (in preference of males) in the mathematics and computer sciences field. Faculty salary is significantly predicted by sex, faculty position, field, and years since obtaining a PhD. Based on the model obtained,changes in faculty position/rank result in the largest changes in salary.\nData on female and male enrolled graduate students, PhD recipients, salary, rank, and discipline are essential to understanding the disparities and inequities that exist in academia. The graduate enrollment data provided by the U.S. Department of Education’s National Center for Education Statistics Higher Education General Information Survey should continue going forward so that solutions can be devised to address inequities between genders in academia. Information on doctoral recipients and their median salaries provided by the National Science Foundation’s National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics Survey of Earned Doctorates will be helpful in the larger gender pay disparity discussion in academia, as well as the entire economy. Survey data gathered by Fox J. and Weisberg, S. (2011) An R Companion to Applied Regression, Second Edition Sage on professor characteristics and associated salaries will be useful in illuminating disparities among salaries based on faculty characteristics. A more thorough assessment of the data that goes beyond a survey in the future will lead to more accurate data regarding these two variables. Continued and improved data collection by American institutions in the coming years on graduate student enrollment, PhD recipients, and faculty salaries will provide policy makers, activists, and career professionals with the tools necessary to decrease pay inequities and improve the equity of sexes and professional representation in the future.\n References  ","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"eb396ea556800974c454e65dfd7f01f2","permalink":"/project/phds-by-field/assignment_5_rmarkdown/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/phds-by-field/assignment_5_rmarkdown/","section":"project","summary":"Introduction The ratio of male-to-female enrolled students in U.S. colleges changed throughout the 20th century.
