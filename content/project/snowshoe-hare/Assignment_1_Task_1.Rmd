This project calculates the mean weight (g) of a sample of Showshoe Hares in the Bonanza Creek Experimental Forest. The sample data collected from 1999-2012 reveals information on species health in the region. Mean weight and sample size of male and female Showshoe Hares for the sample are illustrated below:
